neoCL is the name of the core tool (neo Command Line) and also the name of the full tools package.
It inherits the concept of the much bigger neoCL which is a parallel CL for AutoCAD (not distributed).

neoCL is a set of tools to use as a pyRevit extension.
It's a command line to call neoCL scripts with commands instead of buttons.
In the future it will give access to more scripts or options that are not in the ribbon.

Tools for now :
1. neoCL | neo Command Line
2. Family Replacer
3. iParameters Editor
4. Find and Replace
