neoCL | neo Command Line _______________________________________________________________________________________________________

An extension for pyRevit in Autodesk Revit.

A set of tools, mainly to process data, but also other type of tools.
Evely Excel dependent to speed up data process.

There is a core tool, that gives the name to the package (neo Command Line), it can call the scripts with commands instead of buttons and it gives access to more scripts or options that are not in the ribbon.

Tip: Makes more sense to call neoCL with shortcut keys.
	(SHIFT+N, just my personal preference)
     	File -> Options -> User Interface -> Keyboard Shortcuts: Customize...
