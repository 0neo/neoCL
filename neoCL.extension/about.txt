neoCL | neo Command Line _______________________________________________________________________________________________________

neoCL is the name of the core tool (neo Command Line) and also the name of the full tools package.
It inherits the concept of the much bigger neoCL which is a parallel CL for AutoCAD (not distributed).

neoCL is a set of tools to use as a pyRevit extension.
It's a command line to call neoCL scripts with commands instead of buttons.
In the future it will give access to scripts or options that are not in the ribbon.

Tip: Makes more sense to call neoCL with shortcut keys (SHIFT+N, just my personal preference).
     File -> Options -> User Interface -> Keyboard Shortcuts: Customize...

Keep neoCL updated:
     pyRevit tab -> pyRevit panel -> Settings -> Core Settings -> Check updates at startup
